# OpenID Federation Wallet Architectures 1.0

This repository contains the OpenID Federation for Wallet Architectures specification.

It outlines the general architecture of a federated trust infrastructure for wallet ecosystems, identifying participant roles and defining metadata used for those roles.
In particular, it defines the metadata for the roles of Wallet Provider and Wallet Relying Party.

Additionally, it provides practical examples of how to apply policies for typical use cases within wallet ecosystems and offers guidance on defining trust marks for use within wallet ecosystems.
